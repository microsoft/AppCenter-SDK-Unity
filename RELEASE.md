# Release 1.1.0

**Analytics**

* **[Feature]** Add new trackEvent APIs that take priority (normal or critical) of event logs. Events tracked with critical flag will take precedence over all other logs except crash logs (when AppCenterCrashes is enabled), and only be dropped if storage is full and must make room for newer critical events or crashes logs.
* **[Feature]** Add support for typed properties. Note that these APIs still convert properties back to strings on the App Center backend. More work is needed to store and display typed properties in the App Center portal. Using the new APIs now will enable future scenarios, but for now the behavior will be the same as it is for current event properties.

**Android**

* **[Fix]** Preventing stack overflow crash while reading a huge throwable file.
